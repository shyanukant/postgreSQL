## ðŸš€ PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL quick start 


## Commands

Database Connection
```bash
  \c [DATABASE NAME]
``` 
Create Database 
```bash
  CREATE DATABASE [DATABASE NAME];
``` 
Delete Database
```bash
  DROP DATABASE [DATABASE NAME];
``` 
Show all databases
```bash
  \l
```
Create Table 
```bash
  CREATE TABLE [table name](column_name BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                date_column DATE);
``` 
Show all tables

```bash
  \dt
```
Show table details
```bash
  \d [TABLE NAME]
```
Delete Table
```bash
  DROP TABLE [table name];
```

Database Connection

```bash
  \c [DATABASE NAME]
``` 
Show entries 
- All entries(*)
- Select column

```bash
  SELECT * FROM [table name] ;
  SELECT [column_name] FROM [table name];
  SELECT [column_name, column_name] FROM [table name];
``` 
Show entries in Order - By default Ascending , Descending(DESC)
```bash
  SELECT [column_name] FROM [table name] ORDER BY [table name];
  SELECT [column_name] FROM [table name] ORDER BY [table name] DESC;
``` 
Add entry into Table
```bash
   INSERT INTO [table name] (column, column_date) VALUES('value', DATE '2022-11-22' );
``` 
Upload file 
```bash
   \i [file path];
``` 
Show unique data (no repetitive)
```bash
   SELECT DISTINCT [column_name] FROM [table name];
``` 
Group the Similar Data based on Select column
```bash
    SELECT [column_name] FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name];
``` 
Group data with count(how many Similar )
```bash
    SELECT [column_name, count(*)] FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name];
``` 
Group data with count(how many Similar ), Also in order
```bash
    SELECT [column_name, count(*)] FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] ORDER BY [column_name];
```
Get group data with count condition
```bash
    SELECT [column_name, count(*)] FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] HAVING count(*) > 5 ;
    SELECT [column_name, count(*)] FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] HAVING count(*) > 5 ORDER BY [column_name];
``` 
Find the row entry by one entry - WHERE
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name]='[entry]';
``` 
Delete an entry
```bash
 DELETE FROM [table_name] WHERE [column_name] = [entry];
```
Delete All entries
```bash
 DELETE FROM [table_name];
```
Get multiple entries
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name]='[entry]' OR [column_name]='[entry]';
```
Get multiple entries using the Array - IN
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name] IN ['entry', 'entry2'];
``` 
Find entries by BETWEEN, for example- the date
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name] BETWEEN '[entry]' AND '[entry2]';
```
Find entries with LIKE by related data[word] , 
- % -> no matter how many words
- _  -> one alphanumeric, two(__), and so on
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name] LIKE '%[word]%';
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name] LIKE '___[word]%';
``` 
Find entries with ILIKE - case insensitive 
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] WHERE [column_name] ILIKE '%[word]%';
```
Show data in the limit, like the Above 5 entries
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] LIMIT(5);
```
Show all data except the above 5 entries
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] OFFSET(5);;
```
Show 5 entries except for the above 5 entries
```bash
    SELECT * FROM [table name] LIMIT(5) LIMIT(5);
```
The arithmetic function of PostgreSQL, 
- MIN - minimum value
- MAX - Maximum value
- AVG - average value
- SUM - submission value
- ROUND - Remove decimal
```bash
    SELECT MAX(column_name) FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT SUM(column_name) FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(column_name)) FROM [table name] ;
```
Group data by arithmetic function
```bash
    SELECT [column_name], MIN(column_name) FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] ;
    SELECT [column_name], MAX(column_name) FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] ;
    SELECT [column_name], AVG(column_name) FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] ;
    SELECT [column_name], SUM(column_name) FROM [table name] GROUP BY [column_name] ;
```
Arithmetic operation (+, - , *, /, %)
```bash
    SELECT 10 + 2 ;
    SELECT 10 - 2 ;
    SELECT 10 * 2 ;
    SELECT 10 / 2 ;
    SELECT 10 % 2 ;
    SELECT 10^2 ;
```
Calculate the percentage, for example - 10% value 
```bash
    SELECT [column_name], column_name * .10 FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT [column_name], ROUND(column_name * .10,2) FROM [table name] ;
```   
Assign the name of the percentage column by AS.
```bash
    SELECT [column_name], ROUND(column_name - ROUND(column_name * .10,2)) FROM [table name] ;
    SELECT [column_name], ROUND(column_name - ROUND(column_name * .10,2)) AS [new column_name] FROM [table name] ;
```
COALESCE - Add default value into empty shell
```bash
    SELECT COALESCE(column_name, 'default value') FROM [table name] ;
```
if we divide any number with zero, shows an error 'division by zero', so uses NULL instead of zero. But the output is not zero, it is empty, use COALESCE to show zero.
```bash
    SELECT COALESCE(number/NUll, 0);
```
NullIF - takes two arguments if both are the same, then the output is null otherwise takes the first argument for the operation
```bash
    SELECT number/NUllIF(0,0);
    SELECT COALESCE(number/NUllIF(0,0), 0);
```
Date and time
```bash
    SELECT NOW();
```
Only Date
```bash
    SELECT NOW()::DATE;
```
Only Time
```bash
    SELECT NOW()::TIME;
```
ADD and Subtract date and time using INTERVAL
```bash
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 YEAR';
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 MONTH';
SELECT NOW() - INTERVAL '10 DAY';
SELECT NOW() + INTERVAL '10 YEAR';
```

AGE - To calculate age 
```bash
  SELECT [columns, AGE(NOW(), date_column)] AS [new column] FROM [table name];
``` 
####  ALTER
Add new column into table
```bash
 ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD COLUMN [column name] [DATA TYPE];
```
Delete column 
```bash
ALTER TABLE [table_name] DROP COLUMN [column name];
```
Drop PRIMARY KEY
```bash
 ALTER TABLE [table name] DROP CONSTRAINT "[table_name]_pkey";
```
Add PRIMARY KEY
```bash
 ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD PRIMARY KEY(id);
```
Add Constraint into column
```bash
ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD CONSTRAINT [constraint name] UNIQUE (column or columns);
```
Add Check constraint
```bash
ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD CONSTRAINT [constraint name] CHECK (gender = 'Female' OR gender = 'Male' OR gender = 'Agender');
```
#### UPDATE
Update your column or columns
```bash
 UPDATE [table_name] SET [column] = ['entry'] WHERE [column] = [entry];
 UPDATE [table_name] SET [column] = ['entry'], [column] = ['entry'] WHERE [column] = [entry];
```
Don't show error on the Screen and don't reflect previous entry
```bash
INSERT INTO [table_name](columns) VALUES('[entries]') ON CONFLICT (entry) DO NOTHING;
```
Overwrite Insert Entry.
```bash
INSERT INTO [table_name](columns) VALUES('[entries]') ON CONFLICT (entry) DO UPDATE SET [column name] = EXCLUDED.[column name];
```
#### FOREIGN KEY
```bash
  CREATE TABLE [table name](column_name BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
                column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                date_column DATE, column_name BIGINT REFERENCES [table 2] (id)) ;
  
  ALTER TABLE [table_name] ADD COLUMN [column_name] BIGINT REFERENCES [table_name 2] (id);

  UPDATE [table_name] SET [reference column_name] = 2 WHERE [table 2 id] = 1;
```
Join two table by FOREIGN KEY relationship
```bash
SELECT * FROM [table_name] JOIN [table_name2] ON [table_name].id = [table_name2].id;
```
Join two table record including which don't have FOREIGN key relationship.
```bash
SELECT * FROM [table_name] LEFT JOIN [table_name2] ON [table_name].id = [table_name2].id;
```
Export Data - CSV file
```bash
\copy (your query) TO '[directory_path]/data.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```
#### EXTENSIONS
Show all Avialble Postgre extensions
```bash
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
```
Install Extension
```bash
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "[extension name]";
```
Show Avialble functions
```bash
\df
```
Run extension's functions
```bash
SELECT [fuction_name()];
```
For example - We can use uuid_generate_v4() fucntion of UUID (unique identifier) Extension instead of BIGSERIAL. it's generate random hexdecimal id.
```bash
  CREATE TABLE [table name](id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
                column_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
                date_column DATE);
```
```bash
   INSERT INTO [table name] (id, date) VALUES(uuid_generate_v4(), DATE '2022-11-22' );
```
